# Data Structures Code Dump! 💻🔥

Sup programmers! 👋 Finally decided to organize my Data Structures code collection. 

**Disclaimer:** These are all college-level implementations - they work but aren't super optimized (hey, we were just trying to pass! 😅)

## What's included: 📚

### Linear Data Structures 📋
- Singly Linked-List, Circular Linked-List
- Stack using structure, Stack using Linked-List, Stack operations
- Linear Queue, Circular Queue, Queue using Linked-List

### Trees and Graphs 🌳
- Binary Search Tree using Linked-List
- BFS & DFS Graph Traversals

### Hashing 🔐
- Hash Table (Division with Linear Probing)
- Hash Table (Multiplication with Quadratic Probing)

### Expression Evaluation ➗
- Infix to Postfix
- Postfix Evaluation

## How to run: 🚀
```
gcc filename.c 
./a.out
```

All code is in plain C - nothing fancy, just the standard libraries. 👨‍💻

## Note 📝
Found a bug? Open an issue or just fix it yourself - that's what I'd do! 🐛 These are from college assignments, so they focus more on understanding the concepts than being production-ready.

Feel free to grab whatever helps! ✌️
